<h2>Problem:</h2>
Traffic crisis and high traffic volume around An-Najah National University area (New Campus area)/Nablus.

<h2>Solution:</h2>
Mobile application that engages students and drivers of public transport in solving the problem and organizing the process of coming and leaving from and to the university, which contributes to alleviating the traffic crisis and the random movement of cars in NNU new campus area.

<h2>Abstract:</h2>

An-Najah National University sits at the entrance to Nablus from the west, an important route for people coming from nearby areas. Because of this, the area around the university gets really jammed with traffic, making students late for class and causing them to wait a long time for rides.

Our solution for this is a smartphone app for booking taxis. It's made with students and taxi drivers in mind. With the app, students can see where available taxis are on a map, figure out how far away they are from the university gates, pick their destination and type of car, see how much it'll cost, chat with the driver, and track the taxi's location in real time.

For taxi drivers, the app makes it easy to manage orders. They can see the jobs assigned to them, decide whether to take them or not, say if they're available or not, know where the students want to go, report traffic problems to help other drivers, and keep track of how much they've earned and how far they've driven each day.

There's also an admin page for overseeing things like approving new drivers, managing the university gates, and changing taxi fares. Our smart system groups students by location, so taxis can pick up multiple riders heading in the same direction, saving time and letting drivers handle more jobs.

While taxi apps are common in many places, they're new to Palestine. And our system, especially with the smart grouping, is something totally fresh here, promising to make getting around easier for everyone.
